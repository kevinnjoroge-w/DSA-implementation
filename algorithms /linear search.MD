 # For a linear search , the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This type of search is simple to implement but can be slow for large lists.
 # It follows the rules of the if loop , which is to check the condition and if it is true, then execute the code inside the loop
 # it uses O(n) time in worst case scenario and O (1) for the the best scenario and O(1) for best scenario.
